# C.R.U.X Crisis Management System by 9Tales
## - built with laravel framework using MVC architecture


# Introduction
C.R.U.X serves as a platform to allow collaboration between government agencies in times of occurrence of crises (Fire/Flood). It not only allows crisis handling by providing immediate responses and assistance to resolve the crisis, it also shows the transition from an incident to a crisis when an incident had gone beyond the required safety measures, and the transition when a crisis transiting to an incident whenever a crisis is no longer in the alert zone levels . When an incident is being reported by a member of public, call centre operators will lodge the incident’s information into C.R.U.X and monitor if it goes beyond the safety alert level. Given the case when it had surpassed the alert level, assets will be dispatched from relevant agencies to deal with the crisis. In the midst of the resolving the crisis, key decision makers will be able to observe the status changes, and notify the PMO via email as well as the public via social media channels (Twitter, Facebook, or SMS).

# Product Features

## Incident Management
C.R.U.X allows call operators to log an incident when an incident happens and subsequently monitor the situation. The system will send a notification to commanders of related emergency agencies informing them of the current situation. An incident can be escalated into “Crisis” status if it hits any requirement stated in our policy definition. If the incident/crisis is determined to be over, call operators can choose to delete incident.

## Display Incident Status
Once created, users are able to view the situation of the incident. These included the number of casualties, area and infrastructure affected. It must be updated in real time. At the same time, a map will be marked with a marker showing the location of the incident. 

## Communications
C.R.U.X has an in-built communication platform that comes in the form of a chat room to further facilitate different government agency in sharing their resource and plans to tackle the crisis.

## Assets Tracking
C.R.U.X will also provide the numbers and location of the manpower and personnel deployed to handle the crisis from different emergency agencies. This is shown through a different coloured marker marked on the map. 

## Update Live Information
C.R.U.X allows different government bodies to share their information and then post notification to the public through social media update such as Twitter and Facebook as a single entity. Also, SMS will be sent out to the members of public. This allows information feeds to be publish frequently so that public will be better notified on the current situation crisis.
